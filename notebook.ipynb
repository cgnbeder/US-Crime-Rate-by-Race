The term “forcible” was removed from the offense name, and the definition was changed to “penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.”\n\nIn 2016, the FBI Director approved the recommendation to discontinue the reporting of rape data using the UCR legacy definition beginning in 2017.\n\n**General comments**\n\nThis table provides the number of persons arrested nationwide in 2019 broken down by race and ethnicity of the arrestee. In addition, the table shows the percent distribution of arrests by race and ethnicity for each offense. The table also furnishes a breakdown of these data by juveniles (persons under age 18) and adults.\nThe totals provided in this table reflect only those persons arrested by law enforcement agencies that provided race information to the UCR Program; therefore, the totals may not match those shown in other arrest tables for the nation.\nThese data represent the number of persons arrested; however, some persons may be arrested more than once during a year. Therefore, the statistics in this table could, in some cases, represent multiple arrests of the same person.\n\n**Methodology**\n\n- The data used in creating this table were from all law enforcement agencies submitting 12 months of arrest data, including race information, for 2019.\n- The rape figures in this table are aggregate totals of data submitted using both the legacy and revised UCR definitions of rape.\n\n**Population estimation**\n\nFor the 2019 population estimates used in this table, the FBI computed individual rates of growth from one year to the next for every city/town and county using 2010 decennial population counts and 2011 through 2018 population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau. Each agency’s rates of growth were averaged; that average was then applied and added to its 2018 Census population estimate to derive the agency’s 2019 population estimate.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e77d22fa-2ca7-4ccd-9086-4da9856f4c57"},{"source":"import pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_excel(\"edited_fbi_table43.xlsx\")\ndf.columns = df.columns.str.strip()\ndf.columns = df.columns.str.capitalize()\nprint(df.isnull().any())\nprint(\"--------------------\")\nprint(df.info)","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":null,"lastExecutedAt":null,"lastExecutedByKernel":null,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":616,"type":"stream"},"1":{"height":38,"type":"stream"}}},"cell_type":"code","id":"7f63deb8-7e3d-4292-b5ff-19f51a812448","outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"Offense charged                                    False\nTotal                                              False\nWhite                                              False\nBlack or\\nafrican\\namerican                        False\nAmerican\\nindian or\\nalaska\\nnative                False\nAsian                                              False\nNative\\nhawaiian\\nor other\\npacific\\nislander      False\nTotal.1                                            False\nWhite.1                                            False\nBlack or\\nafrican\\namerican.1                      False\nAmerican\\nindian or\\nalaska\\nnative.1              False\nAsian.1                                            False\nNative\\nhawaiian\\nor other\\npacific\\nislander.1    False\nTotal.2                                            False\nHispanic\\nor\\nlatino                               False\nNot\\nhispanic\\nor latino                           False\nTotal.3                                            False\nHispanic\\nor\\nlatino.1                             False\nNot\\nhispanic\\nor latino.1                         False\ndtype: bool\n--------------------\n<bound method DataFrame.info of                                    Offense charged  ...
